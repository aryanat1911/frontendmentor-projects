          <p class="review">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more
            so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.
          </p>
          <p class="comments">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
            course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks
            was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          <p class="review">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
          <p class="comments">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure
            from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”

            them and
            learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
          <p class="comments">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
            program
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
